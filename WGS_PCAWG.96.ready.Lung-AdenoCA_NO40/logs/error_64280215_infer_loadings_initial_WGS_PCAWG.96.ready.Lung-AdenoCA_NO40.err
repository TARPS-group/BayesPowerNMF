Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception: gamma_lpdf: Inverse scale parameter is 0, but must be > 0!  (in 'unknown file name' at line 27)

If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.

WARNING:pystan:n_eff / iter below 0.001 indicates that the effective sample size has likely been overestimated
WARNING:pystan:Rhat above 1.1 or below 0.9 indicates that the chains very likely have not mixed
WARNING:pystan:5803 of 6000 iterations saturated the maximum tree depth of 12 (96.7 %)
WARNING:pystan:Run again with max_treedepth larger than 12 to avoid saturation

WARNING:pystan:E-BFMI below 0.2 indicates you may need to reparameterize your model
